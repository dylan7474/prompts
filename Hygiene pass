Add project docs and license:

1) Create README.md that describes:
   - What the application is
   - How to build on Linux (make)
   - Basic controls 
   - A short roadmap section.

2) Add LICENSE with MIT License (copyright: Dylan Jones, 2026).

3) Create and Verify Makefiles build: no code changes, just docs and license.

4) Add an executable configure script that checks for essential build tools and libraries, providing installation hints when any are missing

5) Add an AGENTS.md file to help with future AI coders

Commit to a new branch docs/readme-license and open a PR titled:
docs: add README with build instructions + MIT LICENSE
